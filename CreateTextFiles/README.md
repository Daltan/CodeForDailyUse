# Information
Python file you can run from comman line or bash with
```
python MakeFile.py
```
However a **filelist.txt** is required, which means that you must create a file named `filelist.txt`, in which you must type the files' name you wanna to create.

For example, if  you want to create files in the follwing name:

- 1.txt
- 2.txt
- 3.txt

Then you must type the following strings in your own **filelist.txt** file:

```
1.txt 2.txt 3.txt
```

Don't add a **'enter'** in the end, put the python file (which end with `.py`) and the `filelist.txt` file in one directory, and please just type the name and their suffix with simple **space**.
