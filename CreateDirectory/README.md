# Info
This python file `MakeDirectory.py` is to create directories whose name is from `dirlist.txt`. Each name should be on one line.

For example, if I want to create a list of directories whose name the months in `/home/`, move the `MakeDirectory.py` to `/home/`, like `/home/MakeDirectory.py`. Then create `dirlist.txt`, the contents are:
```
Feb
Mar
Apr
May
Jun
Jul
Aug
Sept
Oct
Nov
Dec

```

Then `/home/Feb/`, `/home/Mar/` etc. will be created.
